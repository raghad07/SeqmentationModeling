# Building Segmentation Model for Image Analysis

This project focuses on building a segmentation model using TensorFlow for image analysis tasks. The goal is to accurately classify and segment different objects within images, particularly buildings.

## Project Overview

1. **Importing Python Libraries**: The necessary Python libraries are imported, including TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and others.

2. **Downloading the Dataset**: The dataset required for training the segmentation model is downloaded using Kaggle's API.

3. **Creating the Dataset**: A function is implemented to convert the image paths into a DataFrame, ensuring that the images and their corresponding masks are matched correctly.

4. **Splitting the Datasets**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. The shapes of the resulting sets are displayed for verification.

5. **Image Preprocessing and Data Augmentation**: Functions are defined to read and preprocess images, including resizing and normalization. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as random flipping and brightness adjustment are applied to increase the diversity of the training data.

6. **Creating the Data Pipeline**: A data pipeline is established using TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` API. The pipeline includes shuffling, mapping the preprocessing functions, batching, and prefetching for efficient processing.

7. **Image Visualization**: The first batch of images from the training dataset is plotted, displaying the original images and their corresponding masks for visual inspection.

8. **Building the Autoencoder Model**: An autoencoder model is constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both comprising multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization and activation functions.

9. **Model Summary and Visualization**: The summary of the autoencoder model is displayed, and a visual representation of the model's architecture is generated.

10. **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained and evaluated using the prepared datasets. The training process, including loss calculation and optimizer selection, is implemented.

11. **Inference and Results**: The trained model is used for inference on unseen images, and the results are analyzed and presented.
